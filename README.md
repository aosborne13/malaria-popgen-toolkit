# malaria-popgen-toolkit
A collection of reproducible population genomics workflows for *Plasmodium* species, designed to support transparent, accessible, and scalable malaria genomic analysis.

## In collaboration with VivaxGEN
This toolkit has been formatted to interpret and analyse whole genome sequencing (WGS) data that has been processed using an open access ngs-pipeline toolkit designed by VivaxGEN, available at: https://github.com/vivaxgen/ngs-pipeline

Filtered WGS data following mapping and QC using alternative pipelines can also be used with this toolkit. For vcf files, the csq field is preffered which can be generated using *bcftools*, available at: https://github.com/samtools/bcftools.
