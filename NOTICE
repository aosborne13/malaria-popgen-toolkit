malaria-popgen-toolkit

© 2025 Ashley Osborne

This toolkit is designed to analyze whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data exported
from open-access malaria genomics pipelines, including but not limited to:

- VivaxGEN NGS pipeline by Hidayat Trimarsanto (Anto) and Ludwig Kian Soon Hoon
  https://github.com/vivaxgen/ngs-pipeline

- fastq2matrix pipeline by the LSHTM PathogenSeq Lab
  https://github.com/LSHTMPathogenSeqLab/fastq2matrix

The downstream analysis scripts, workflows, and command-line interface in the
malaria-popgen-toolkit are independently developed and maintained.

This toolkit can be applied to data generated from these pipelines or similar
open-source workflows. Reference to external pipelines is provided for user
convenience and does not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or ongoing collaboration.
